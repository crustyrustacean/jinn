## v0.102.0 (development build)

- Fix slow startup performance on `install` and `config` commands.
- Add `--force` flag to `install` command to overwrite existing files.
- Fix positioning of file selection and prompt selection popups to be word-wrap aware. They now appear directly over the cursor instead of above the input box.
- Provide base directory in context for loaded skills to help agent load reference files.
- Add MCP server support.
- "Nag" system defaults changed: 200 chat entries + disabled

## 2026-07-23 v0.101.0

- Add ability to load skills directly via the skill picker using `<c-l>`.
- Skills that have been loaded can no longer be disabled from the skill picker.

### New Feature: Project Record

A new "record" file can be placed at `./agents/RECORD.md` which lists out current high-level facts about the project.

The idea behind the record is that it always gets managed by a human and gets surfaced during every feature change. Humans can easily read and edit the record, and the agent has been instructed to only write approved edits to the record. The agent loads it and so gains an understanding of how things are _supposed_ to work which should (in theory) speed up codebase exploration during planning. It also helps (but doesn't eliminate) the problem of docs drifting from the actual implementation since the record gets referenced regularly.

For example, a fact might be "The database backend is SQLite so the application can be ran easily standalone" and a new feature request might be "Add Postgres support". This pre-existing fact will get surfaced during planning so the developer can be made aware of potential implications of the feature.

The implementation is prompt-based and all relevant planning and analysis prompts have been updated to support managing the record. Note that this takes slightly more tokens since extra work is being performed. But the token cost shouldn't be significant since the agent will already have the relevant code loaded into context during planning and evaluation.

Currently its just a markdown file. As I experiment with using it, it might get changed to a vector search or some other lower-context mechanism.
