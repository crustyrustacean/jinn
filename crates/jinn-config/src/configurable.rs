//! The `Configurable` trait — the one registration a `jinn.toml` section
//! needs to be readable and writable by the configuration layer.
//!
//! Every section declares its own dotted key and, when it owns a
//! list-of-tables, the field identifying an entry. The layer stores raw
//! TOML and is generic over the section type, so it never names a
//! section: adding a subsystem's config means implementing this trait in
//! that subsystem, and touching nothing else.
