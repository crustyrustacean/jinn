//! Cross-platform process-tree termination.
//!
//! Provides two entry points:
//!
//! - [`kill_process_tree`] — terminates a spawned child _and its entire
//!   descendant tree_. Used by the bash tool's `KillOnDrop` guard. Takes the
//!   `&mut Child` directly.
//! - [`kill_process_group_by_pid`] — terminates the process group rooted at a
//!   bare PID. Used by the session-lifecycle cancel path, which does **not**
//!   own the `Child` (it lives inside the reader task) and must not block or
//!   lock. Safe to call from a tokio runtime worker thread.
//!
//! Each platform uses its most appropriate mechanism:
//!
//! - **Unix** — `libc::kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`. Race-free and atomic: the kernel
//!   delivers the signal to every member of the child's process group in one
//!   syscall. Descendants spawned before the call are guaranteed to die.
//! - **Windows** — [`kill_tree`] enumeration via `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`.
//!   See the Windows branch below for the documented TOCTOU trade-off.

/// Terminates `child` and its entire process tree.
///
/// Infallible by design: this is invoked from `Drop` impls and synchronous
/// cancel handlers where propagating an error is neither possible nor useful.
/// Failures (e.g. the process already exited) are logged at `warn` level and
/// otherwise swallowed. The helper performs **no async operations** and must
/// not depend on a tokio runtime context.
