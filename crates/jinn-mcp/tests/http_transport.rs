//! HTTP transport integration tests: failure and latency behavior.
//!
//! These verify the load-bearing properties of the managed-HTTP path that are
//! independent of any particular MCP server implementation:
//!
//! - **Bad command** (AC4): a nonexistent binary fails to spawn, surfacing the
//!   error rather than hanging.
//! - **Process exits before connect** (AC4): a short-lived process (e.g.
//!   `false`) exits immediately; `connect_with_retry` returns `Err` carrying
//!   the captured output, not a hang.
//! - **Slow boot, no false Dead** (AC5): a long-running process that never
//!   speaks HTTP keeps the connect loop retrying indefinitely — the bounded
//!   timeout below proves the loop is *still trying* rather than having
//!   flipped to `Dead`.
