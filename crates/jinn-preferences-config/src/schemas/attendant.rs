//! The `[[attendant.entry]]` list — saved attendants, restorable by name.
//!
//! A saved attendant is a snapshot of one session's run configuration taken
//! when the user saves it from the properties popup: how it fires, what it
//! does to its context, the model and persona it runs under, and the pins
//! that carry its standing instructions. Creating from an entry reproduces
//! the configuration verbatim and inherits only what a saved file cannot
//! know — the creating session's cwd, project, and the rest of its
//! environment.
//!
//! The entry stores the *session-state* types (`AttendantBehavior`,
//! `AttendantTrigger`, `ModelSelection`, `ReasoningEffort`, `Endpoint`) via
//! serde rather than TOML-native stand-ins, so restore means "deserialize"
//! and never "translate field by field" — a divergence between the entry
//! shape and the session shape cannot compile.
