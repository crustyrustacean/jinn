//! Standalone schema + migration crate for jinn's session store.
//!
//! This is the **single source of truth** for the SQLite schema. It is consumed
//! in two places, both of which must see the same schema:
//!
//! - **Build time:** `jinn-kernel/build.rs` calls [`run_migrations`] on a fresh
//!   `OUT_DIR` database, then points `dao`'s `#[dao]` macro at it via
//!   `DAOW_DATABASE_URL` for compile-time SQL validation.
//! - **Runtime:** jinn's session store calls [`run_migrations`] through a
//!   `dao::Pool::with_conn` closure on the user's `sessions.db` at startup.
//!
//! Living in its own crate (a leaf — no dependency on `jinn-kernel`) is what
//! breaks the bootstrap cycle: `build.rs` can depend on this crate via
//! `[build-dependencies]`, whereas it cannot depend on the crate it belongs to.
//!
//! See the `dao` crate's README ("The schema-crate pattern") for the rationale.

/// Migrations apply atomically inside a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT`
/// transaction (see [`migrate::run_pending`]); a failure or an interrupt (e.g.
/// Ctrl+C / SIGKILL) before `COMMIT` rolls the whole chain back to the
/// last-applied version, leaving no half-applied schema.
///
/// The FK toggle below (`foreign_keys=OFF` … `ON`) wraps the transaction. The
/// pragmas stay *outside* `run_pending`'s `BEGIN` because SQLite forbids
/// changing `foreign_keys` inside an open transaction. The toggle is
/// essential: DDL such as `DROP TABLE sessions` (used by the v15/v16/v20
/// table-rebuild migrations) performs an implicit `DELETE` of all rows, which
/// would otherwise fire the application-level `ON DELETE CASCADE` and wipe
/// every `session_history` and `token_ledger` row. After the migrations
/// complete (or fail), FK is re-enabled.
///
/// The `foreign_key_check` integrity walk runs after a migration-applied run,
/// **in debug builds only**. The migrations run with FK enforcement off, so
/// this walk is the only verification their key writes kept the database
/// referentially sound — a developer's safety net for a broken migration,
/// caught on the first upgrade run against a seeded test database. An
/// end-user release build skips it: there is no automated repair for a
/// violation (failing the launch would strand the user over data nothing
/// can fix), and the walk is measured in seconds on large databases —
/// invisible debug overhead it may be, but a startup stall it is not.
///
/// Safe to call on an empty database (bootstraps the tracking table) and
/// idempotent on a fully-migrated one (the version check short-circuits
/// before any `BEGIN`).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if any migration fails or if the FK pragma cannot be
/// toggled. In debug builds, also when `foreign_key_check` reports integrity
/// violations after a run that applied migrations.
