//! The per-frame write pass — slice-registered pre-render hooks.
//!
//! The render loop needs one write lock on shared state per frame, and
//! the bookkeeping that has to run under it is mostly *slices'*
//! business: the sidebar measures its preview geometry, the terminal
//! overlay sizes its pty, the chat input re-wraps its draft. Composition
//! used to call those functions by name, which meant the TUI layer had
//! to import every slice whose numbers it happened to need.
//!
//! This registry moves the *call sites* out of the TUI layer. A slice
//! registers a [`PreRenderHook`] at activation; the render pass takes
//! the write lock once and runs every hook under it.
//!
//! ## Why the state type is a parameter
//!
//! A hook's first argument is `&mut S`, the application state. This
//! crate cannot name `AppState` — it is the extraction seam and depends
//! only on `jinn-theme` and `ratatui`, never on `jinn-kernel`. So the
//! hook list is generic over the state type and the kernel instantiates
//! it at `AppState`.
//!
//! The list itself is reached through [`Slices`](crate::Slices), which
//! type-erases it behind `dyn Any` — the same trick the draw registry
//! uses for slice-owned elements. That keeps the seam invisible: a
//! slice's `activate` asks its host for the hook list, exactly as it
//! asks for its cells, and neither the host's constructor nor the
//! `Services` struct grows a field.
//!
//! ## Hooks return their publishes
//!
//! A hook does not publish. It returns the closures it wants sent, in
//! order, and the render pass sends them on its own bridge. This keeps
//! the bridge — a kernel type — out of the hook signature, and keeps
//! the publish order identical to the call order.
