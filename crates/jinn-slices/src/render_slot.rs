//! The slice-owned draw registry — one draw function per render region.
//!
//! A region is a *place on screen that composition fills*, not a slice.
//! Composition decides where the chat log goes; the chat-log slice
//! decides what is painted there. This registry is the seam between
//! the two: a slice registers [`DrawFn`] for a [`Region`] at
//! activation, and the render pass calls it with the rect it computed.
//!
//! Two properties follow from that split, and both are the point:
//!
//! * **The slice names its own region, not its own element.** A draw
//!   function is registered under a [`Region`] key, so composition
//!   stops string-matching a slice's element name in order to find it.
//! * **An unregistered region paints nothing.** That is the same
//!   degradation `OverlayViews` has always had, and the startup
//!   pairing check is where a missing registration is caught.
//!
//! The registry is generic over the render context, so it can be
//! declared here without naming `jinn-kernel`'s [`RenderCtx`]:
//! `jinn-kernel` must not depend on a slice crate, and this crate
//! depends only on `jinn-theme` and `ratatui`. The kernel instantiates
//! it at its own `RenderCtx`; a slice instantiates it at whatever
//! context its draw function needs.
