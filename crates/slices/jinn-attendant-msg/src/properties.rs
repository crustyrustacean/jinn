//! Attendant properties popup — the edit state for its seven fields.
//!
//! The popup is a two-phase vim-style form over an attendant's trigger,
//! behavior, prep mode, tool set, skill set, model, and seed template.
//! `j`/`k` move the form cursor between fields, `h`/`l` act within the
//! focused field, and `i` opens the seed-template editor on its own scope.
//! Every edit stays pending — the popup never touches the session — until
//! the user applies every field at once. The values the session had at open
//! are snapshotted so leaving restores them exactly.
//!
//! Prep mode cages the two rows above it. While the attendant is being
//! composed nothing runs, so its trigger and behavior are values the user
//! has written but that do not apply; they stay on screen, dimmed, and the
//! cursor cannot reach them, which is a stronger statement than letting the
//! cursor arrive and having the pick do nothing. The tool and skill rows sit
//! *below* the prep row and are never caged: an attendant being composed
//! still has a tool budget, and a frozen set is what the attendant is being
//! composed *for*. The model row is never caged for the same reason: which
//! provider an attendant will run under is settled while composing it, not
//! after.
//!
//! Choice rows carry their display order and labels here ([`TRIGGER_CHOICES`],
//! [`BEHAVIOR_CHOICES`], [`MODEL_CHOICES`]) so the renderer and the pick
//! helpers share one source of truth; nothing downstream hardcodes a choice
//! string.
