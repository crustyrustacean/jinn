//! The help card — the panel that explains the focused field.
//!
//! Pressing `?` on any row of the attendant properties form opens this: a
//! bordered card naming the focused field and describing what it accepts,
//! with its selectable words in the same color the form itself uses so the two
//! agree on which words are pickable and which are explanation.
//!
//! Separate from [`super::properties_overlay`] because it is a different widget
//! with a different job. The form renders a fixed-height grid of fields; this
//! renders a variable-height document that has to be measured, wrapped, and
//! placed against the form's own bounds — and it is the only thing in the slice
//! that does any of that. It reads the form's state and draws; it never writes.
