//! The permission engine behind the properties form's per-field setting.
//!
//! Each of an attendant's tool and skill filters is a set of names and globs,
//! and the form's job is to let the user move one entry in or out of that set
//! with a direction and a set-mode. This owns that: which field a row is
//! setting, what the next set-mode is in the current direction, what the
//! attendant may actually reach right now, and whether the filter it is about
//! to write already holds a pattern.
//!
//! It is separate from the rendering and from the save path because it is the
//! only part that answers questions about the attendant's *current* reach,
//! and that reach is derived rather than stored: a name the attendant cannot
//! use is not part of what a freeze is meant to preserve, so the answer is
//! computed from the registry and the enablement filters each time rather than
//! read from a snapshot that could disagree with them.
