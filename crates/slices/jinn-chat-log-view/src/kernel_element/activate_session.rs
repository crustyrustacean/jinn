//! Activation lives in one function because three callers need it — the
//! sessions list, the session picker, and subagent entry — and they were
//! already drifting apart. Each decided for itself whether a measurement was
//! due, and the subagent path decided it never was, so a large in-memory child
//! laid its history out inline on the frame it was opened. One entry point
//! means the three cannot drift again.

/// regression rather than a bug.
