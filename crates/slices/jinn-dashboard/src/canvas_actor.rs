//! The dashboard actor — owns the dashboard slice cell on trouper.
//!
//! Aggregates three data sources into a single dashboard view:
//!
//! - **The runtime's actor census** — receives [`trouper::ActorLifecycle`],
//!   which the runtime broadcasts system-level at every actor spawn and
//!   stop. This is what makes the dashboard a census rather than a
//!   curated list: a row appears for an actor that publishes no
//!   jinn-level event of any kind, and no spawn site in any slice needs
//!   to know the dashboard exists.
//! - **Generic service status** — receives [`ServiceStatusUpdate`]
//!   published by whichever feature owns a service, adding a
//!   human-written description, status message, and note tone to that row.
//! - **Keyboard navigation** — receives [`DashboardNav`], bridged from
//!   the dashboard feature's keybind rows.
//!
//! The two sources are deliberately asymmetric, and the asymmetry is
//! structural rather than promised: the runtime decides *whether a row
//! exists and whether it is alive*, a feature decides *what its row
//! says*. [`ServiceStatusUpdate`] carries no lifecycle field at all, so
//! a feature cannot contradict the runtime's verdict on whether its
//! actor is alive — the dashboard's fold is the sole writer of that
//! state.
//!
//! This actor is a feature-agnostic sink: features translate their own
//! state into the generic event, so no feature-specific type appears
//! here. It owns the dashboard's slice cell exclusively: the cell is
//! minted by [`Slices::register`](jinn_slices::Slices::register)
//! at actor wiring, and this actor holds the one write handle. The
//! renderer and the intent router resolve read handles.
//!
//! The actor runs on the trouper runtime ([`ServiceActor`] tier: a
//! stateless fold into shared state, no journaling). The cell handle
//! cannot ride the runtime's JSON start args, so it is injected
//! through the builder's
//! [`start_with`](trouper::builder::ServiceBuilder::start_with)
//! override.
