//! The poise gateway frontend, merged into the slice crate as `backend`.
//!
//! Owns the poise gateway task and slash-command handlers that drive a running
//! jinn instance from Discord. The domain-layer pieces (config, thread-map DAO,
//! message splitter, bridge actor) live in the slice's top-level modules
//! ([`crate::authorize`], [`crate::thread_map`], [`crate::message_split`],
//! [`crate::bridge_subscriber`]).
//!
//! See `.plans/discord/plan.md` for the full architecture.
