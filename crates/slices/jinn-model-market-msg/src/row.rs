//! One table row: a single OpenRouter listing joined with its epoch ECI.
//!
//! `MarketRow` is the disk-cache payload (`Serialize + Deserialize`), so
//! its field set is wire-compatible with the OpenRouter listing the
//! models actor fetches, normalized for display: prices as `f64`
//! USD/token, the ECI join resolved ahead of render. PROJ is **not**
//! stored — it is computed at render time from the active mix preset, so
//! `m` re-sorts without a refetch.
