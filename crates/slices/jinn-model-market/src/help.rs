//! The `?` help card — a detached-looking sub-widget the popup's own

//!
//! `?` flips [`MarketUiState::help_visible`] (the input hook owns the
//! key); while it is set the popup's view places this card below itself
//! and draws it: Clear, then the bordered card surface, then the text.
//! The card documents the table's columns and the detail mode's
//! columns and semantics — the on-screen facts, not the key inventory
//! (the footer carries that).
//!
//! The shape follows the attendant's properties help card: a
//! variable-height document measured against the popup's inner width,
//! wrapped here (the card must know its height before it can be
//! placed), and painted with theme-semantic colors — explanation text
//! in the theme's text colors, column names in the accent the table
//! itself wears, the card's surface the theme's info-popup background.
