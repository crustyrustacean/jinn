//! The model-market slice — an OpenRouter-only model picker with cost
//! projection and Epoch ECI quality data.
//!
//! `<leader>so` opens a centered full-table popup (dynamic scope
//! [`jinn_model_market_msg::market_ui_scope`]): one row per text-output
//! OpenRouter listing, columns for prices, a render-time cost projection
//! under the active mix preset, and the Epoch Capabilities Index joined
//! by display name. ENTER switches the session model through the same
//! `ProviderSwitch` crossing the provider picker publishes.
//!
//! Two cells, two owners. [`jinn_model_market_msg::MarketDataState`] is
//! written only by the slice's actors (fetch, parse, cache — nothing
//! blocking ever runs on the key thread);
//! [`jinn_model_market_msg::MarketUiState`] is written only by the sync
//! side (route actions, the input hook, the render pass). The opener
//! resets the UI cell and publishes `FetchModels`; the actor serves warm
//! cache or network.
//!
//! `lib.rs` declares every module of the slice; the territories that
//! fill them own whole files and never touch this one:
//!
//! - `routes` — the opener row, every in-popup key, the filter hook
//! - `view` — the overlay render pass (table, status line, footer)
//! - `ui_state` — pure helpers over the two cells
//! - `format` — display formatting shared by view and tests
//! - `seed` — the compiled-in epoch CSVs (T2)
//! - `epoch`, `epoch_cache`, `epoch_actor` — epoch download/parse/join (T2)
//! - `eci_aliases` — the compiled-in name-join alias table (T2)
//! - `or_models`, `or_endpoints`, `market_cache`, `rows` — the
//!   OpenRouter fetch/cache/row-build layer (T3)
//! - `openrouter_actor` — the models/endpoints actor (T3)
//! - `help` — the `?` help card (T4)
