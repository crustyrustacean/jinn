//! The model-market popup's route rows and input hook.
//!
//! Every key the popup responds to is either a [`RouteRow`] this slice
//! attaches or a hook case. The split follows the dispatch order the
//! kernel guarantees — **bound route rows resolve before the input
//! hook** — and, decisively, the popup lives in an input-hook scope:
//! every printable key is owned by the hook, so *any* character key
//! would be unreachable as a row inside the popup's own scope. The
//! non-character keys are rows:
//!
//! - `<enter>`/`<esc>`/`<c-r>` and the four navigation keys bind as
//!   rows (`<up>`/`<down>` plus their `j`/`k` twins);
//! - every printable character is a hook case: with the filter focused
//!   it types into the filter; with the table focused, `f`/`i` focus
//!   the filter, `?` toggles the help card, and `h`/`l`/`s` run their
//!   sort actions. If those were rows, route dispatch would
//!   consume them before the hook and typing "mistral" into a focused
//!   filter would flip sorts instead of filtering.
//!
//! Focus and mode live *inside* the row actions: the rows fire wherever
//! focus is and whichever mode is active, so `<enter>` and `<esc>`
//! branch on [`MarketUiState::
//! filter_focused`](jinn_model_market_msg::MarketUiState::filter_focused)
//! and [`MarketUiState::
//! detail_model`](jinn_model_market_msg::MarketUiState::detail_model)
//! themselves — a focused filter turns ENTER into "accept the filter"
//! and ESC into "clear the filter"; detail mode turns ENTER into
//! "confirm the highlighted endpoint" and ESC into "back to the table".
//! The branch order inside every action is filter → detail → table.
//!
//! Fetches ride one key only: the table-mode ENTER drill-in. Highlight
//! motion, sorts, and filter accept/clear publish nothing — the detail
//! content fetches when the user drills into a row, never as a side
//! effect of moving the highlight.
