//! Provider-selection crossing contracts — the commands and events other
//! actors and slices consume, plus the provider cell vocabulary.
//!
//! The crossing-schema ids ("ProviderSwitch", "ModelsRefreshed", …) derive
//! from the type names, so they are part of the wire contract and must not be
//! renamed. The prompt-scan pair
//! (`RescanPromptTemplates`/`PromptTemplatesLoaded`) belongs to
//! `jinn-session-init-msg`, its producer's crate.
//!
//! The cell vocabulary ([`ProviderCell`], [`provider_state_slot`]) lives
//! here, not in the slice crate, because the *readers* include
//! kernel-resident code (the provider/endpoint picker specs, the TUI
//! renderer) and sibling slices (status-bar, context-curation, boot);
//! the *writer* is the slice's `ProviderActor`. Neither depends on the
//! other.
