//! The sidebar's slice-owned rendering registrations.
//!
//! The chat layout draws a border between the main column and the
//! sidebar, and a bottom line under the content. Both lines change
//! colour with whatever owns the focused scope — the sidebar claims
//! the focused accent, the sidebar's *resize* mode claims its own
//! transient accent, and every other scope leaves the chrome unfocused.
//!
//! Those are the sidebar's own rules, so the sidebar states them here,
//! once, at activation. The chrome reads a registered hint instead of
//! matching the string `"sidebar"` against a scope id.
//!
//! The four surfaces that overflow the column — the archive-tree prompt,
//! the close-session prompt, the session preview, and the task-list
//! preview — register separately, against
//! [`jinn_slices::Region::FloatingSurfaces`]. They reach left across the
//! chat column, and the render pass draws the chat column *after* the
//! sidebar, so painting them from the column's own draw call would put
//! them underneath it. Their own layer is what makes the column's
//! contents and the surfaces that overflow it two different draws.
