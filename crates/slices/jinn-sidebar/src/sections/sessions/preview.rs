//! Session preview popup - shows the last few entries of a highlighted session.
//!
//! Rendered as a bordered overlay when the sidebar sessions section is focused.
//! The popup is anchored bottom-right: its right edge aligns with the right
//! edge of the terminal (just left of the sidebar), and its bottom edge sits
//! just above the sessions section. Displays the last 5 entries rendered using
//! the same entry pipeline as the real chat log, truncated to the last 20 lines.
//! A footer at the bottom shows keybinds across two lines, then the shared
//! status line the chat input's status bar draws — the previewed session's
//! cwd, then its stats and model — with every value taken from the
//! *previewed* session, never the active one.
//!
//! The lines themselves are *not* built here. They arrive already rendered from
//! the layout worker, keyed by the settled entries' content rather than by
//! history length, so a frame costs a refcount bump and a draw. A lookup that
//! misses — because the content or the width moved — falls back to the lines the
//! session is already holding, so the popup is never replaced by a spinner over
//! content it has drawn. Only a session that has never been drawn shows the
//! loading indicator; see [`render_session_preview_loading`].
