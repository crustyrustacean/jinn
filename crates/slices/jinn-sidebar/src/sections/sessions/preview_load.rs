//! Requesting a session preview render, and the content identity that decides
//! whether one is needed.
//!
//! The preview popup's lines are rendered by the layout worker rather than the
//! frame loop, so moving the cursor over a large session costs the UI nothing but
//! a spinner. That only works if a render is *asked for* at the right moments,
//! which is what lives here.
//!
//! The identity here is deliberately blind to entries that are still producing.
//! A preview shows *settled* messages: a reply still streaming is represented by
//! a bounded continuation marker, and its text is never rendered. Folding such
//! an entry into the key would move it on every token and re-request a full
//! render for the whole turn, which is the flicker this module exists to
//! prevent. See [`preview_signature`].
//!
//! Requests originate on the keyboard path only. The render pass has no bus
//! handle — the frontend's job is to read state, not to publish — so it records
//! the width it drew at and draws a spinner when nothing is cached. A terminal
//! resize therefore re-requests on the next cursor move rather than instantly;
//! the alternative was handing the render path a publisher for one message.
//!
//! Because requests come from the keyboard, they are also where duplicates are
//! stopped: a second request for content already cached or already rendering
//! would queue a job for lines nothing would read.
