//! Skills crossing contracts — the events and commands other slices
//! consume. The scanning actor lives in the session-init slice; kernel
//! consumers (the session actor, the task settle listener) reference
//! these types and the reverse bridge carries these exact Rust types.
//! Re-homed from the kernel `feat/skills/protocol.rs` in the
//! session-history window; the crossing-schema ids ("SkillsLoaded",
//! "ScanSkills") are unchanged.
