//! The theme picker's route rows and input hook.
//!
//! Every key the theme picker responds to is a [`RouteRow`] this slice
//! attaches itself; the kernel contributes no keybind, no scope variant, and
//! no picker identifier.
//!
//! Two shapes are worth knowing:
//!
//! - **Actions** carry a closure that runs against the picker's own cell and
//!   reach app state only through [`SliceActionState::as_any_mut`] — the
//!   same seam `jinn-sidebar`, `jinn-term`, `jinn-project`, and
//!   `jinn-session-lifecycle` already use.
//! - **The filter** is an *input hook* rather than rows, because `RouteRow` has
//!   no catch-all variant. Registering the hook makes the composition keymap
//!   synthesize the printable-character catch-all and the editing keys for
//!   this scope, so typing keeps working.
//!
//! A cell guard is never held across an await: every action snapshots what it
//! needs, mutates, and drops the guard before it returns.
