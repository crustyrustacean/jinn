//! The tool filter's runtime gate: a withheld tool is refused where the call is
//! routed, not only where the prompt is built.
//!
//! These drive the REAL delivery path — `ExecuteToolBatch` published on the
//! trouper bus, the spawned orchestrator resolving the tool, and the
//! `ToolExecutionCompleted` coming back — because the defect they guard is one of
//! reachability. A filter applied only to the assembled prompt looks correct in
//! every prompt-level test while the tool itself stays callable by name.
//!
//! The refusal is asserted on the observable result the model receives, not on
//! whether a task was spawned: the point is what the model is told.
