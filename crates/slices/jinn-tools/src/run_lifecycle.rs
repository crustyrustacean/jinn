//! The `run_lifecycle` tool — run a session lifecycle script's setup, or
//! replay a session's recorded teardown.
//!
//! The two actions read their coordinates from different places, and the
//! schema says so: `action` and `session_id` are the only required
//! arguments, and everything else is setup-only.
//!
//! **Setup** carries the script coordinates in the call: the user's
//! `jinn.toml` by name, or — when a `path` is given — that exact file, with
//! the name selecting the entry inside it (the sources never combine). The
//! script's named arguments are supplied in the call and shell-quoted
//! before substitution. Setup records the script name, the arguments in
//! the raw template's parameter order, and the source file on the session
//! *before* the run command publishes, and persists the session — those
//! coordinates are what teardown replays, and they must survive a restart.
//!
//! **Teardown** takes only the session id. Script, path, and argument
//! arguments are ignored — every one of them — and the command re-renders
//! from the session's stored coordinates, the same ones a close would
//! replay. A caller cannot teardown a session with coordinates the session
//! never recorded.
//!
//! Everything dangerous is borrowed, not reimplemented: argument values
//! render through `CommandTemplate`'s shell-quoted path (the same one the
//! arg-input popup feeds), execution goes through the lifecycle actor's
//! terminal-isolated runner, a setup that prints a directory still moves
//! the session there, and the actor enforces one lifecycle command per
//! session at a time — a second call for a busy session is refused with a
//! visible failure, not queued and not clobbered.
