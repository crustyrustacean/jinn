//! How a tool turns a user-supplied path into one it can touch.
//!
//! Every filesystem tool takes a `path` argument that the model writes, and
//! that path is usually relative — to whatever directory the session's working
//! directory happens to be. Resolving it is the same arithmetic for every tool
//! (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `save_plan`), so it lives here rather than being
//! restated four times: a tool that resolved paths its own way would be a tool
//! that could disagree with its siblings about which file a name refers to.
//!
//! Resolution is purely lexical. It does not canonicalize, expand `~`, or touch
//! the filesystem, so it cannot fail and cannot be surprised by a symlink.
