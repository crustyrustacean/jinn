//! The work-time monitor actor — the only writer of working-time intervals.
//!
//! Folds [`WorkStateChanged`] into the wall-clock intervals held in the
//! work-time slice's cell. It deliberately never reads a session's phase: the
//! phase writers announce the boundary, and a monitor that derived the fact
//! itself would need the same writes the announcers already make, giving two
//! places that disagree about when a turn started.
//!
//! The forced `Idle → Idle` publish for a cancel-consumed-by-frontend race
//! reaches this actor as `working: false` with no interval open, and
//! `end_working` reports no close — so it is a no-op rather than a boundary.
